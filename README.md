# 🌫️ AQI Index Prediction - PM2.5 using Streamlit

This project predicts **PM2.5 concentrations** (fine particulate matter) from air quality datasets using **machine learning** techniques. A **Streamlit web app** is used for interactive visualization and predictions.

 📌 Project Overview

Air pollution, especially PM2.5, poses serious health risks. This app allows users to predict PM2.5 levels using features like **year, timestamp, day, and time** from historical air quality data.

 🔍 Features:
- PM2.5 prediction using machine learning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Interactive Streamlit interface
- Visualizations of AQI trends
- User-friendly input form for predictions

 📁 Dataset

The dataset should contain the following columns:

- `year` – Year of data record
- `timestamp` – Date and time
- `day` – Day of the week
- `time` – Hour or part of the day
- `PM2.5` – Target variable (concentration of particulate matter)

You can use any similar dataset with these features. Example: Beijing PM2.5 dataset (UCI ML Repository or Kaggle).

 ⚙️ Setup Instructions

 1. Clone the Repository



PM2.5 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less — about 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair. These tiny particles are a major component of air pollution and can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream.

🧪 What is PM2.5 Made Of?
PM2.5 is a mixture of: Sulfates, Nitrates, Ammonia, Carbon (soot), Organic compounds, Metals, Dust or smoke from combustion, industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, etc.

⚠️ Health Disadvantages of PM2.5
PM2.5 is especially dangerous due to its small size and ability to remain airborne. Here's how it affects people:

🫁 Respiratory Issues:

Causes or worsens asthma, bronchitis, and lung infections
Reduces lung function, especially in children and the elderly

❤️ Cardiovascular Effects:

Increases risk of heart attacks, strokes, and hypertension
Can lead to irregular heartbeat and blood vessel damage

🧠 Other Health Effects:

Linked to neurodevelopmental disorders in children
May increase the risk of dementia in older adults
Associated with low birth weight and premature birth

😷 Long-Term Exposure:

Leads to chronic respiratory diseases
Increases risk of lung cancer
Reduces overall life expectancy

🏙️ Who is Most at Risk?

Children and infants
Elderly individuals
People with pre-existing heart or lung conditions
Outdoor workers
Residents in high-pollution areas



We predict PM2.5 in this project because it is a critical indicator of air quality and public health risk. Here's why it's important:

🎯 Purpose of Predicting PM2.5
1. Public Health Protection

By forecasting PM2.5 levels, authorities and individuals can take preventive actions:
Advise vulnerable groups (children, elderly, asthma patients) to stay indoors
Issue air quality alerts
Reduce exposure through masks, air purifiers, etc.

2. Early Warning System

Real-time prediction helps in early detection of pollution spikes, which are often caused by:
Traffic congestion
Industrial activity
Crop burning
Weather patterns (e.g., low wind)

3. Policy and Planning

Helps governments design pollution control policies and traffic regulations
Guides decisions like banning firecrackers, implementing odd-even traffic schemes, etc.

4. Environmental Monitoring

Continuous prediction and monitoring allow for better understanding of:
Pollution patterns over time
Impact of seasons, holidays, or lockdowns
Source identification and regional variations

5. Data-Driven Decision Making

Machine Learning allows accurate, adaptive prediction based on historical and current features (like time, weather, traffic, etc.)
Offers an affordable and scalable alternative to expensive physical sensors

🔬 Why Machine Learning?

PM2.5 levels are influenced by complex patterns and multiple factors.
ML can model these non-linear relationships better than basic statistical methods.
Enables near real-time predictions with minimal manual intervention.
